             'leaves only a bootstrap code in the bytecode to launch the '
             "application's unpacking phase, which is present in a native "
             'library libDexHelper.so. The business logic of the application '
             'is located in the native library, and the first step in the '
             "analysis is to find the bytecode containing the application's "
             'business logic.',
