  "content": "Google regularly updates its algorithm to improve search results quality, which can impact websites positively or negatively. Independent sites like HouseFresh keep track of these updates to ensure their content remains relevant. However, despite editorial decisions being made with readers in mind, big media publishers such as BuzzFeed, Rolling Stone, Forbes, Popular Science, and Better Homes & Gardens consistently appear at the top of search results for various products, including air purifiers and cooling sheets. These publishers often rely on marketing materials and Amazon listings without firsthand testing, leading to a lack of trustworthy information. While Google introduced a reviews system in 2021 with the Products Review Update, big media publishers have been adversely affected by subsequent algorithm updates.",

  "content": "The author found it difficult to keep track of tasks and responsibilities in their head while in college. They tried various productivity apps and methods but found them unhelpful due to the constant growth of tasks. Instead, they started tracking everything in a single text file, which has been their primary productivity system for 14 years. The author uses an online calendar to schedule all future plans and appointments, which they then append to the end of the daily todo list in their text file. This allows them to know exactly what they need to do each day. The process also helps the author evaluate if they have too much work for a day and break down larger tasks into smaller ones for more manageable scheduling.",

  "content": "htmz is a minimalist HTML microframework that allows developers to create modular web user interfaces using familiar HTML syntax. It has zero dependencies, zero JS bundles to load, and no backend is required. htmz lets users swap page fragments with HTML code from the server, updating only the relevant portion of the page without reloading the whole page. The framework is inspired by similar architectures such as htmx, Comet, and \"HTML As The Engine Of Application State.\" To use htmz, developers can copy a provided snippet into their page and use a hyperlink or form with specific attributes to invoke it. The loaded content replaces the selected destination, allowing for more powerful operations like replacing, deleting, and inserting content.",
