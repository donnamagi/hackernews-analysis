The paper explores the use of control vectors for various tasks, including reading off whether a model is ""power-seeking"" or ""happy,"" and adds a ""happiness vector"" to make the model act forgetful about pipe bombs. The author of this blog post has created a Python package called RAISINs that allows users to easily create their own control vectors in less than sixty seconds.

The goal was to replace the plastic gemstone and single LED with their own circuit board, using the same metalwork. However, the challenge lies in shrinking the design by a factor of 3 while avoiding a thick border around the board, which makes routing tracks difficult. To give a sense of scale, three small 0201 LEDs are shown next to a regular surface mount LED, and an ATtiny85 is also shown with an 0201 LED on its back. The creator mentions that it's possible to get multilayer boards made with blind and buried vias, but these boards can be expensive, starting at several hundred dollars for a small batch.

The author notes that Gemini Pro 1.5's context window is significantly larger than previous models, allowing it to comfortably accept entire works of rationalist doomer fanfiction and even fit all of Eliezer Yudkowsky's 1,967-page opus Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality into each message sent to Gemini. The author considers this a major achievement for two reasons: the larger context window enables Gemini Pro 1.5 to perform more complex tasks and accept longer inputs, and the model's ability to comfortably handle larger inputs is a significant improvement over previous models like GPT-4 Turbo, which can only accept a limited number of tokens.",2024-02-23 15:23:40,2024-02-25 23:00:00

The method uses a Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) of key feature maps and has fewer than 0.6% of the total parameters in the original generative model.",2024-02-23 22:46:46,2024-02-25 23:00:00

The author explains that this problem occurs when the system's default libc has been compiled without frame pointers, causing any stack walking to stop at the libc layer, resulting in missing application frames. The article highlights that Fedora and Ubuntu are releasing versions that fix this issue by compiling libc and more with frame pointers by default, making off-CPU flame graphs more practical and customer adoption easier for continuous profilers. The author also provides a visual explanation of how stack tracing works using the x86-64 ABI's ""base pointer"" register %rbp to walk stack frames.",2024-03-17 03:59:07,2024-03-20 23:00:00

The law directed the finance minister and head of the central bank to come up with an inflation target, which could lead to the head of the central bank being fired if not met. While some were concerned that an inflation target could lead to higher employment, the former head of the central bank suggested a target of zero to 1% in a casual remark.

The authors use HQQ+, an adaptation of HQQ that utilizes a low-rank adapter to enhance performance, and demonstrate that even at 1-bit quantization, the output quality significantly improves compared to smaller full-precision models. They also find that fine-tuning pre-trained models under extreme quantization settings can lead to improved results, despite the challenges involved.",2024-03-28 10:58:34,2024-03-30 23:00:00
