However, they have reached the limits of what can be achieved with a CPU-based 2D renderer, leading them to explore other options. They tried using Cairo but found it difficult to retarget and had slow corner cases. They then decided to write their own GPU rendering library, which initially showed impressive results in performance. However, they struggled to find the right balance between performance and rendering quality, so they put the development on hold. Their next option is Skia, which they did not consider initially due to lack of a public library with API stability that distros can package. Now that they have more experience maintaining third-party dependencies, they are willing to give Skia a try internally to see if it's worth the effort of maintaining it as a third-party module.",2024-02-20 07:46:45,2024-02-20 23:00:00
